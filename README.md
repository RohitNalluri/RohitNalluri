- 👋 Hi, I’m Rohit Nalluri
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, GenAI, RAG, AWS, Azure, GCP (all things Cloud), SaaS, Blockchain, Metaverse, Web3, NFTs, Cryptocurrency, 3D Printing, DevOps and Coding. I am interested in creating products.
- 💞️ I am building _indian-rag_: a core RAG engine for Indian databases and Indian context. This core engine will power India-specific SaaS products such as _Nirnai_ (AI Lawyer), _Chanakya_ (AI Accountancy), _dharmadex_ (AI Sanatana Dharma), _raagam_ (AI Indian Classical Music - Hindustani and Carnatic), and _Quotable_ (beautiful quotes).
- 💞️ I am building _BabelBridge_, a simple webapp that lets content creators dub their content into any language in their own voice.
- 💞️ I am building _popcorn_, an offshoot of BabelBridge that automatically dubs any movie or tv show into any Indian language while maintaining the original voice and lip sync.
- 💞️ I am the founder of _Physible_, a merchandize company that collaborates with NFTs/Blockchain-gaming projects to convert their metaverse objects into cool, physical merch using the power of 3D Printing! (Deprecated)
- I wear my cape during the day and fight financial crime as a Product Owner with Danske Bank.
