- 👋 Hi, I’m RohitNalluri
- 👀 I’m interested in AWS, Azure, GCP (all things Cloud), AI, Blockchain, Metaverse, Web3, NFTs, Cryptocurrency, Web3, Physibles, DevOps and Coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create Web3 applications using Solidity (ETH) and on the XRPL.
- 🌱 I’m also currently learning to create ChatGPT-like interfaces using langchain and Zapier. The idea is to use OpenAI APIs and Langchain to create AWS & Azure Chatbots to create conversational AIs that can help create the best architectural patterns and solutions.
- 💞️ I run and manage Physible, a merchandize company that collaborates with NFTs/Blockchain-gaming projects to convert their metaverse objects into cool, physical merch using the power of 3D Printing!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on decentralized apps and metaverse content. I am currently developing a series of NFTs to display and share on the XRP Ledger, as well as ongoing collaboration with an NFT Project to turn them into #physibles using 3D Printing.
